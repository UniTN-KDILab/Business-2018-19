Hello there, at the top 
level of this directory you will find the report, this READMe, and
3 directories:

ER = ER model, as source code and html file. Also the model without
	attributes used in the report.

ontologies = 1) Our ontology, before integration 2) CSK 3) The ontology
	integrated with CSK.

extra = Links to data and extra scenarios (what we could not fit in the report).

!The data links should contain 22 datasets, some of
them are quite big (everything may pile up to some GBs) while some of them were scraped (by third parties).
Let us know if you need anything and are not able to access them
from the provided links.
